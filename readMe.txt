Project: 'AMONG US 3d'



**Project Description:**

My project, Among Us 3d, is a game inspired by the recently popular “Among Us”. 
My project recreates the primary features of “Among Us” but transforms 
the 2d user experience into a 3d world with raycasting. Among Us 3d features a
single player mode, which is unique to my project. Because of this, it includes
complex game AIs and AI pathfinding algorithms.


**How To Run:**

- The user may need to download the simpleaudio module.
- The user should have 'cmu_112_graphics.py' accessible.
- To run the project, the user should run "amongUs3d.py' in the editor.
- Further, my project contains many image files and sound wav files. Within
    my folder management, these are stored in folders labeled 'gameImages' and
    'gameSounds'. The user may need to download these image and wav files from
    my google docs submission.


**Modules:**

- I am using the simpleaudio module. This is quick and easy to install with 
    pip.
- No other modules/libraries installations are necessary for this project 
    besides including 'cmu_112_graphics.py' in the project folder.


**Shortcut Commands**

-'Tab': opens the map
-'v': When the map if open and v is pressed, the game AIs become visible to 
    the user on the map.
-'arrow keys' to move player. 
- Most of the user interaction is via the mouse clicking on the screen.
