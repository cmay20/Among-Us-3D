## 15-112 Term Project: AMONG US 3D

This project was developed for my 15-112 Term Project. 

**Among Us 3d** reimagines the game [Among Us](https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/) with pseudo-3D graphics and a singleplayer mode with AI.  


### Setup

- Download repository. Open in IDE of choice (I use VSCode for this project).
- Download [simpleaudio](https://pypi.org/project/simpleaudio/) module with ```pip install simpleaudio```


- The user should have 'cmu_112_graphics.py' accessible. This project uses this graphics file built by Carnegie Mellon Staff that extends Tkinter features.  
- To run the project, run "amongUs3d.py' in the editor. 
- Further, my project contains many image files and sound wav files. Within
    my folder management, these are stored in folders labeled 'gameImages' and
    'gameSounds'. The user may need to download these image and wav files.

### How To Play
- Goal: Complete all tasks to repair your ship with fellow crewmate AIs before the imposter elimates each of you. 
- Can choose to play as Crewmate or Imposter via the pregame menu.

#### Shortcut Commands
- 'Tab': opens the map
- 'v': When the map is open and v is pressed, the game AIs become visible to 
    the user on the map.
- 'Arrow keys' to move player. 
- 'Mouse click' for other game interaction.
